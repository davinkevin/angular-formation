# Angular Formation

## Introduction

* Kevin, Me and Myself... 
* Everyone will learn, you and me !
* Don't be afraid to ask...
* OpenSource Formation !
* Collaborative formation: If you found something, contribute !

## Summary

* The past, present and future
* Angular as a platform
* Deep dive into Angular
* Testing for real !


## The past, present and future

### Technology 

* Flash, SilverLight, GWT...

### Rise of new tech
* Rise of modern browser
* Rise of Libraries (jQuery, Mojo)
* Rise of Frameworks ! (React, VueJS, Ember)

## Angular as a Platform

### Language 

* First choose to sub-class TypeScript with AtScript
* Then choose to team up with Microsoft with TypeScript and use it by default
* Keep using Dart in other Branch of the system, with differents team
* And we can still use vanilla Javascript if we want... but it's deprecated

### Tooling

* Augury
    * Show routing system
    * Show Injector
    * Show properties
* Angular Compiler for Ahead Of Time Compilation
    * Goal of AOT
* Codelyzer
    * Tools to help to code better
* Introducing the AngularCLI
    * Description of main Features
* Karma, Jasmine and Protractor in TypeScript


### Relying on... 

* RxJS 5.X
    * TP About RxJS : RxJS 101
* ZoneJS
    * TP about ZoneJS : Measuring timing with ZoneJS
* Injector for Dependency Injection
    * Link to Dagger2
    * Simple example
* Reflect Metadata
