# Angular Formation

## Introduction

* Kevin, Me and Myself... 
* Everyone will learn, you and me !
* Don't be afraid to ask...
* OpenSource Formation !
* Collaborative formation: If you found something, contribute !

## Summary

* The past, present and future
* Angular as a platform
* Deep dive into Angular
* Testing for real !


## The past, present and future

### Technology 

* Flash, SilverLight, GWT...

### Rise of new tech
* Rise of modern browser
* Rise of Libraries (jQuery, Dojo)
* Rise of Frameworks ! (React, VueJS, Ember)
* From Mobile first to Offline first

### Language 

* Javascript... 
* ... to ES2016 and beyond !
* TypeScript
* Retrospective language (with ES5, ES2015, ES2016, TypeScript vern diagram)

## Angular as a Platform

### Language 

* First choose to sub-class TypeScript with AtScript
* Then choose to team up with Microsoft with TypeScript and use it by default
* Keep using Dart in other Branch of the system, with differents team
* And we can still use vanilla Javascript if we want... but it's deprecated

### Tooling

* Augury
    * Show routing system
    * Show Injector
    * Show properties
* Angular Compiler for Ahead Of Time Compilation
    * Goal of AOT
* Codelyzer
    * Tools to help to code better
* Introducing the AngularCLI
    * Description of main Features
* Karma, Jasmine and Protractor in TypeScript

## Deep Dive into Angular

### Anatomy of Angular Application

* @Component
    * Principal Node
    * Tree organization
    * Change detection from root to bottom
    * ViewEncapsulationModule
* @NgModule
    * Center of compilation
    * Attributes : Declaration, import, export... 
    * Visibility of elements of @NgModule in Injector
* @Directive
* @Injectable
* @Pipe

### Relying on... 

* Injector for Dependency Injection
    * Link to Dagger2
    * Simple example
* RxJS 5.X
    * TP About RxJS : RxJS 101
* ZoneJS
    * TP about ZoneJS : Measuring timing with ZoneJS
* Reflect Metadata

### Useful Angular Module : 

* CommonModule
* BrowserModule
* RouterModule
* FormModule (Reactive and Template)

### Testing FTW !

* Everything is testable !
* Unit-Testing in Angular World
    * TestBed et Module Def
    * Way to instantiate elements
    * async, fakeAsync, inject... 
* E2E Testing, let UAT do real exploration tests !
    * What is Protractor / Selenium
    * PageObject paradigme
